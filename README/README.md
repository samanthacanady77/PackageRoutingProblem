# Package Delivery App

This app is a console-based application that solves a modified version of the Traveling Salesman Problem. 
It utilizes a nearest neighbor algorithm to optimize package delivery routes for a package delivery service. 
The app allows you to track packages and view the total distance traveled by the three available trucks.
